## Definition
An .INI file is a type of file that contains configuration information in a simple, predefined format. It is used by Windows OSs and Windows-based applications to store information about the user's preferences and operating environment. These files are plain text files with a basic structure comprised of properties and sections.
It is pronounced as "dot in-ee" or simply "in-ee" file, where .ini signifies "initialization."

## Usages of .ini files
.ini files are used to initiate many applications both on Linux and Windows OS. Since .ini files are commonly used, they are compliant to a specific syntax.
```INI
[heading1]
key1=value
key2=value

[heading2]
a=1
b=2
```
